# dpc-neuron

This project is meant to help me analyze and visualize results from my dental pulp - sensory neuron coculture experiments.

TODO:
- write basic plotting code, no plt wrapper because of memory leak
- design CLI interface
- design internal structure of project
- think about what to add to this list...
